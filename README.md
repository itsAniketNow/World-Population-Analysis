# üåç World Population Analysis & Prediction

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to analyze global population trends, identify key factors influencing population changes, and build predictive models to forecast future population growth. The study considers multiple socio-economic and environmental variables to provide insights into how population growth affects resources, the economy, and policy-making.

## üìä Key Objectives
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand global population trends.
- Identify key factors affecting population growth, such as **GDP, birth/death rates, urbanization, and resource consumption**.
- Build **predictive models** (using **Facebook Prophet**) to forecast future population growth.
- Provide **data-driven policy recommendations** for managing population growth effectively.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Distribution of Population Growth** across different continents.
- **Time-series trends** of population increase and economic growth.
- **Correlation analysis** between GDP, life expectancy, and population growth.
- **Urbanization vs. Population Growth** study.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning & Prediction
### **Prophet Model for Forecasting**
- **Train-test split** on time-series population data.
- **Trend identification** using decomposition techniques.
- **Prediction of future population growth** (next 50 years).

### **Key Findings:**
- **Asia & Africa** are projected to have the highest population growth.
- **Europe & North America** show stagnation or negative growth due to aging populations.
- **Developing economies** need better resource management policies.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project
### **Prerequisites**
Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn prophet
```

### **Run the Analysis**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/world-population-analysis.git
   cd world-population-analysis
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook population_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## üìà Results & Insights
- **Population Forecasts**: Developed a predictive model with **Prophet**, achieving a **high accuracy in long-term trends**.
- **Economic & Resource Impact**: Countries with **rapid population growth** need better policies for **education, employment, and healthcare**.
- **Aging Population Concerns**: Many developed nations face **labor shortages and economic decline** due to an aging population.

---
## üì¢ Future Scope
- Incorporate **deep learning models (LSTM, ARIMA)** for enhanced forecasting.
- Use **interactive dashboards** (Tableau/Power BI) for better visualization.
- Extend analysis to **regional policies & migration trends**.
